function applyValues() {
    counter = 0; //initializing counter (number of passages) to be equal to 0
    timer = 0; //initializing time to be equal to 0

    /*
    STEP 1: 
    Determine the position of the boat (boatX) with an increment for 'Downstream', and a decrement for 'Upstream'
    * Hint: The value of increment/decrement is dependent on velocity. 

    STEP 2: 
    Ensure that TWO out of the three (Boat's Velocity, River's Velocity, or Resulting Velocity) input fields have been filled so that a third value can be calculated.
    Amend the first set of conditional statements which has been done as an example, by displaying an error message with alert() and reset the input fields.

    STEP 3: 
    Ensure that the two values submitted by the user are valid. 
    Add an else if() condition. Then, display a relevant message to inform the user of an error and reset the values.    
    * Hint: Resulting velocity is the sum of initial velocity and velocity of the river.

    STEP 4: 
    Write another set of conditional statements for the upstream direction. 
    In addition to displaying relevant messages and resetting values as seen in STEP 1 & 2, set the selection for direction back to its default 'Downstream' until valid values for 'Upstream' are entered. 
    * Hint: What should the resulting velocity of opposite direction be?  

    STEP 5: 
    Recall that only TWO out of three of the input fields need to be filled by the user. 
    Check the direction selected (i.e. Downstream or Upstream) and calculate the third value.

    Possible scenarios:
    Values for boat velocity and river velocity were entered, calculate resulting velocity
    Values for boat velocity and resulting velocity were entered, calculate river velocity
    Values for river velocity and resulting velocity were entered, calculate boat velocity

    STEP 6: 
    Update the variable (vel/riv/res) that stores values for unit conversion.
